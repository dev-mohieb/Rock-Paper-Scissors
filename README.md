# Rock-Paper-Scissors

I created this project all on my own. The template, styling, color pallete, and of course the JavaScript.
I was supposed to create it step by step through the Odin Project's guiding but I decided I wanted to test my abilities and did the whole thing on my own.

I will keep polishing this project as I learn more but I'm proud of how it turned out right now.
This project took me two days. CSS took the most time.
